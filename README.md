Description :
Futoshiki is a puzzle game originated in Japan and the word futoshiki (sometimes spelt hutosiki ) means inequality. The puzzle is played on a square grid. The objective of the game is to place the numbers such that each row and column contains only one of each digit.
Grid :
The puzzle below is 4 x 4, so we must place 1 to 4 into it - if it was 5 x 5 we would need to place 1 to 5 into it, and so on.

Look at the inequality signs. A less-than sign, <, means that the number it points at must be less than the number on the other side of the sign. Turned around the other way it becomes a greater-than sign, >, but the logic is still the same - the number it points at is smaller than the number on its other side.
Rules :
In a N x N puzzle the range of #'s must be between 1 and N.
No digit is repeated within row or column. No duplicates.
Inequality constraints must be honored: 5 > 4, 5 > 3, or 1 < 4.
